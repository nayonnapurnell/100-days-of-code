**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 01, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I have started the Backend Certification Track on FreeCodeCamp.  I worked on the managing packages with npm.

**Thoughts**:  I was very relieved to begin this program because I struggled heavily with this package during my internship.

### Day 2: January 02, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I created a Todo App with Angular 2 and Ionic 2.

**Thoughts** As simple as this project is, I struggled with the naming conventions and file paths of the folder.  I am still troubleshooting and hope to have this running by tonight.

### Day 3: January 03, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working with #FreeCodeCamp Backend Development Projects.  I tried to finish managing packages with npm.  Got stuck on npm-dist add.

**Thoughts** I believe this project is simple but I had to redo the entire challenge about 3 times. 1-the w9 cloud told me the workspace for the npm account I created was unavailable.  2- By the second attempt I completed the entire challenge up to where I am now.  I go on the next day and all the work I completed did not store.  3-  I redid the entire challenge and am back where I left off.  

I total win for tonight was I helped someone complete a struggle that they had with the FrontEnd Challenge.
