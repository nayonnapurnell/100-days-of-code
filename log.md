**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 01, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I have started the Backend Certification Track on FreeCodeCamp.  I worked on the managing packages with npm.

**Thoughts**:  I was very relieved to begin this program because I struggled heavily with this package during my internship.

### Day 2: January 02, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I created a Todo App with Angular 2 and Ionic 2.

**Thoughts** As simple as this project is, I struggled with the naming conventions and file paths of the folder.  I am still troubleshooting and hope to have this running by tonight.

### Day 3: January 03, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working with #FreeCodeCamp Backend Development Projects.  I tried to finish managing packages with npm.  Got stuck on npm-dist add.

**Thoughts** I believe this project is simple but I had to redo the entire challenge about 3 times. 1-the w9 cloud told me the workspace for the npm account I created was unavailable.  2- By the second attempt I completed the entire challenge up to where I am now.  I go on the next day and all the work I completed did not store.  3-  I redid the entire challenge and am back where I left off.  

I total win for tonight was I helped someone complete a struggle that they had with the FrontEnd Challenge.

### Day 4: January 04, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I am a part of a challenge within a challenge, (Anything to help my accountability until I get a job).  I created a hello world app in javascript and python.

**Thoughts**:  The challenge was great I had to create a readme.md file and the actual files.  The difficulty came when I had to push my project to the specific repo and submit a pull request.  I got through the struggle and am grateful for my support.  I was able to get the help and now I am waiting on pull requests.

### Day 5: January 05, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Reversed a string in Javascript and Python. Created a read me file and pushed to Github.


**Thoughts**:

### Day 6: January 06, Friday
**Today's Progress**:  Working on pull request reviews for the hello world app and the reverse string app.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 7: January 07, Saturday

**Thoughts**:  I am getting tired because sometimes I have to do a ton of research before getting a task accomplished.  I am watching videos and finding articles to guide me in the process.

**Today's Progress**:  Working on an array in javascript and a list challenge in python.

### Day 8: January 08, Sunday

**Thoughts**:  I started creating the database through the Workbench.  I immediately started off with error messages due to syntax errors that I got from the tutorial I followed.  Following tutorials have yet to be a perfect fit for giving directions.  I started off with one tutorial until I couldn't repair the errors.  I have decided that I will continue creating a database but I am looking for projects.

**Today's Progress**:  I began the creation of a database in Mysql though the Msql Workbench.  I was able to download the software and started creating the fields.

### Day 9: January 09, Monday

**Thoughts**:  I have had difficulty the past couple of days getting my projects running.  This was something that took an hour and wasn't difficult to complete.  I had to correct a few error messages and then everything was working.  I was starting to get in a rut so I feel much better.

**Today's Progress**:  I created a Twitter bot that retweets anything with the words #Inspire or #inspire.

### Day 10: January 10, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**:    I practiced javascript array problems.  I saved it and pushed it to the Github repo.

**Thoughts**:  I am apart of a whole year challenge in addition to the 100 day challenge.  I am pleased to do this challenge because it forces me to complete read.md files.  I am also required to save and create files paths within a particular order.  I am also required to make branches and push the commits to the Github repo.  I love these challenges because it requires me to do everything in baby steps but I get to practice very necessary responsibilities of a programmer.

### Day 11: January 11, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**:  Created READ.md files for my javascript practice files.

**Thoughts**:  Creating the read.md files are just as time consuming as the practice.  I realize that the hour of code is a great way to force myself to write the code but it takes much more time.  I usually have to first research how to complete the task, then I have to complete the task.  Then I have to tell how I completed the task and lastly, I have to push it to the Github repo.  It is also challenging trying to decide what I am going to build each day.  I am sure these are all things evolving developers struggle with.

### Day 12: January 12, Thursday
**Today's Progress**:  I researched, deleted, and recreated an Ionic 2 app.

**Thoughts**:  I originally created an Ionic 2 TodoApp.  I thought this App would work because it was a more upto date version.  After doing an ionic serve the app broke.  I was very discouraged because I did not understand the file paths for the folders.  I also realized that software is constantly changing so a tutorial may not work even after a month.  I also realize it depends on the developer who is creating the tutorial.  So the best thing I thought to do was to delete the App and start a new tutorial.

### Day 13: January 13, Friday
**Today's Progress**:  I continued working on the Ionic 2 app.

**Thoughts**:  Sometimes the tutorials seem very straight forward but they can become time consuming when going from screen to screen.  I have to shout out my husband for getting me an extra monitor to attach to my laptop.

### Day 14: January 14, Saturday
**Today's Progress**:  I worked on starting a Node.js server with @freeCodeCamp Challenges.

**Thoughts**:  The challenges are fun but I seem to find myself in little road blocks.  Sometimes people have answered the questions in other tutorials.

### Day 16: January 16, Monday
**Today's Progress**:  I worked with practicing Github, undoing merge requests.

**Thoughts**:  I had to do some research but I was able to reset a commit, create a branch and merge the files after getting repetitive error messages.
