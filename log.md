**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 01, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I have started the Backend Certification Track on FreeCodeCamp.  I worked on the managing packages with npm.

**Thoughts**:  I was very relieved to begin this program because I struggled heavily with this package during my internship.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
